#+title: bemenuFocus
#+author: James Leslie
When using a multi-monitor setup and Sway on Wayland, bemenu doesn't appear on the monitor it is called from. This program fixes that
* Prerequisites
1. [[https://swaywm.org/][Sway]];
2. [[https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu][bemenu]];
3. [[https://www.haskell.org/][Haskell]] (or just [[https://www.haskell.org/ghc/][GHC]] to compile the file).
* Installation
Download this repository and compile the Haskell file:
#+begin_src bash
ghc --make bemenufocus.hs
#+end_src

Change the bemenu option in your Sway configuration file to the following:
#+begin_src conf
set $menu dmenu_path | bemenu -m "$(PATH-TO-REPOSITORY/bemenuFocus)" | xargs swaymsg exec --
#+end_src

Reload Sway and you should find that bemenu now appears on the active monitor. This should work if you have less than 10 monitors.
